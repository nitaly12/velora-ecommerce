// This route handler or action is needed for the form action in profile
// But since I used a form action path "/auth/signout", I need to create a route handler for it.

// wait, I can just make this a route handler at /src/app/auth/signout/route.ts
// or use a server action. 
// Let's create the route handler to match the form action
